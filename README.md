## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

The results from the analysis show that June is a better month for W. Avy's business since is warmer than December; however, the precipitation for both months can allow us to give him a more in-depth analysis.  
Based on the results:

We can see that the precipitation betweem June and December varies at 0.136 and 0.217 correspondignly. 
The maximum for June and December is 4.43 and and 6.42 correspondignly.
Based on these observations the precipitation on a given day in June is lower than in December.
