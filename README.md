# Surfs_up

## Overview of the analysis: 
We created two reports for W. Avy that has the information about temperature trends between the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

## This assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. 
* Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
* Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis that includes results and summary (README.md)

## Determine the Summary Statistics for June 
* A working query is written to retrieve the June temperatures from the date column of the Measurement table.
* The temperatures are added to a list. 
* The list of temperatures is converted to a Pandas DataFrame. 
* Summary statistics are generated for the DataFrame. 
* Code to confirm  Summary Statistics for June can be found in: SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb

## Determine the Summary Statistics for December
* A working query is written to retrieve the December temperatures from the date column of the Measurement table.
* The temperatures are added to a list. 
* The list of temperatures is converted to a Pandas DataFrame. 
* Summary statistics are generated for the DataFrame. 
* Code to confirm the Summary Statistics for December can be found in: SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb

## Written Report
* Results: 
    - The data for the month of June is comprised of 1700 entries. We see that the average temperature is 74.94 degrees F, the maximum temperature is 
      85 degrees F and the minimum temperature is 64 degrees F. As seen in the picture:

    - The data for the month of December  is comprised of 1517 entries. We see that the average temperature is about 71.04 degrees F, the maximum 
      temperature is about 83 degrees F and the minimum temperature is 56 degrees F. As seen in the picture:

* Summary: 

    - The results from the analysis show that June is a better month for W. Avy's business since is warmer than December; however, the precipitation  
      for both months can allow us to give him a more in-depth analysis.  

    - Based on the results:

![December%20Precipitation](https://github.com/cbrito3/surfs_up/blob/main/December%20Precipitation.png)


    - We can see that the precipitation betweem June and December varies at 0.136 and 0.217 correspondignly. 
    - The maximum for June and December is 4.43 and and 6.42 correspondignly.
    - Based on these observations the precipitation on a given day in June is lower than in December.
